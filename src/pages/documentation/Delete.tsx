            Delete operations are <strong>permanent and irreversible</strong>. Always test your filter conditions 
            with a regular query first to ensure you're targeting the correct records.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Test first:</strong> Run the query without <code>delete!</code> to verify which records will be affected</li>
          <li><strong>Use transactions:</strong> Wrap delete operations in transactions when possible</li>
          <li><strong>Backup data:</strong> Consider backing up important data before bulk deletions</li>
          <li><strong>Soft deletes:</strong> For important records, consider using update operations to mark as deleted instead</li>

          <p className="text-blue-700">
            Before running <code>users | where: name = 'John Doe' | delete!</code>, 
            first run <code>users | where: name = 'John Doe'</code> to see exactly which records will be deleted.
